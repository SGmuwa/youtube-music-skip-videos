# YouTube Music skip videos

This extension allows you to skip all videos on YouTube Music. Only tracks without video will be played.

At the moment, the extension when playing video:

1. Adds a song to the playlist `ðŸ“¹ðŸ‘Ž`.
2. Dislike her ðŸ‘Ž so YouTube Music no longer recommends. If the dislike is already set, then it simply skips the song.
